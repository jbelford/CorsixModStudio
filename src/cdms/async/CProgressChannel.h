//! Thread-safe progress reporting channel.
/*!
    Wraps a callback that receives progress messages. The Report() method
    can be called from any thread — the callback itself determines how
    the message is delivered (e.g., directly, or via CallAfter for GUI updates).

    Provides a static RainmanCallback() that is type-compatible with
    Rainman's pfnStatusCallback, allowing seamless bridging.
